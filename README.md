# template-webpack-basic

This is a basic repo template I've created for all projects which require bundling through webpack. It comes pre-configured with HTML Webpack Plugin, CSS Loaders, and the ability to import common image files. The "inline-source" DevTool is enabled for error tracking, and development mode is initialized.

I've also installed ESLint and Prettier, and ensured that they do not conflict with each other.
